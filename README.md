## Game Instructions

This memory game will start with the user having 5 stars. When the user flips the first card, the timer will start. Every two flips count as 1 move. If the two flipped cards match each other, the cards will stay open and be locked. If the two flipped cards don't match, they will be unflipped. User can make as many moves as he/she wants, but user will lose one star when he/she makes 3 moves without matching any cards. User cannot lose any more stars when there is only one star remaining, but moves continue to accumulate as well as the time on the timer until all the cards have been matched.
